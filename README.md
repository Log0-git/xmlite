XMLiTE
------

This was my implementation of an unused sample remover from FastTracker II .XM module files back in 1997. It is very old and might be buggy, but I'm adding it here for the sake of providing information (XM format etc). This was a GitHub gist initially but since it could be compiled straight into an EXE file I moved it here, for the sake of better visibility.
